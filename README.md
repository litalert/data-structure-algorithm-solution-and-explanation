# data-structure-algorithm-solution-and-explanation
This is my solutions to Interview Cake and Leetcode problems. They're mixture of easy/medium problems. When solving these problems frequently enough, you start to notice "patterns" used to solve these problems. At the top of this file, those are the "patterns" I used to solve these problems. And at the end of each problem, there's a summary of what I learned from the problem. I hope this helps those of you who are trying to study out there :)
