-my solutions to Interview Cake and Leetcode problems. They're mixture of easy/medium problems
-when solving these problems enough, you start to notice "patterns" used to solve these problems
-at the top of the file, those are the "patterns" I used to solve these problems
-at the end of each problem, there's a summary of what I learned from the problem
-hope this helps :)
